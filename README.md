# Codecademy-Practice
Code(s) I want to store/reference from the Codecademy course "Pass the Technical Interview with Python"

These are not my original codes, but just code I created with guidance of the Codecademy course listed above.
I do not claim any creation/ownership over the code and am hosting it on Github as notes/reference for my individual future use.
